# Using Advanced Filter API 

The [Advanced Filter API](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-models) is introduced in the revision 1.7.0 of [PowerBI Visuals Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-tools) and enables complex cross-visual data-point selection/filtering queries based on multiple criteria (such as "LessThan", "Contains", "Is", "IsBlank", etc.). 

The Sample Slicer visual takes advantage of Advanced Filter API functionality for the bulk selection of multiple data-points with just a single selection query. The query is generated based on the position of the sliders that intuitively define the selection range.
